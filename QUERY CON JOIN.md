INNER JOIN university.departments
ON degrees.department_id = departments.id

ORDER BY students.surname, students.name;
```

5. Selezionare tutti i corsi di laurea con i relativi corsi e insegnanti

```sql

INNER JOIN university.teachers
ON course_teacher.teacher_id = teachers.id

ORDER BY degrees.name;
```

6. Selezionare tutti i docenti che insegnano nel Dipartimento di Matematica (54)

```sql

ON course_teacher.course_id = courses.id

JOIN university.degrees
ON degrees.id = courses.degree_id

JOIN university.departments
ON departments.id = degrees.department_id

WHERE departments.name = "Dipartimento di Matematica"

GROUP BY teachers.id;
```

7. BONUS: Selezionare per ogni studente il numero di tentativi sostenuti per ogni esame, stampando anche il voto massimo. Successivamente, filtrare i tentativi con voto minimo 18.

```sql
SELECT
    exam_student.student_id,
    students.name AS student_name,
    students.surname AS student_surname,

COUNT(exam_student.vote) AS attempts,

MAX(exam_student.vote) AS vote_max

FROM university.exam_student

JOIN university.students
ON students.id = exam_student.student_id

WHERE exam_student.vote >= 18

GROUP BY exam_student.student_id;
```
